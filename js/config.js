         Tapping this project's card assembles its logo out of its own
         parts before the page opens. See "the mark builds itself" in
         brand.js and in styles.css.

         `src` is the logo Main Marks supplied
         (HRS-Logo-Exact-Transparent.png), cropped to the mark and
         otherwise untouched — verified pixel for pixel against the
         supplied file, so every fragment on screen is their own
         artwork and nothing has been traced or redrawn.

         `cut` is where the eight fragments are divided, as fractions
         of that file. These were MEASURED off its alpha channel, not
         estimated: xStem is the column where the h's stem ends and its
         shoulder begins, xRStem the same for the r, and so on. The
         eight rectangles they describe tile the whole file with no gap
         and no overlap — which is what guarantees that assembled they
         are the logo EXACTLY, and why no fragment can be a shape the
         logo does not contain.

      /* --- What is being sold: Moray's product lines ----------------------
         Moray is sold as FOUR products, and three of them carry their own
         brand. Opening Moray shows one card per line; the card is the way
         in and the first filter. Each is dressed in ITS OWN identity, from
         its own brand book, never in another line's:

           admin      no brand of its own — Moray's charcoal ground, Moray's
                      wordmark, and the brochure's own section heading
                      ("/ ADMINISTRATIVE SPACES", PDF p.35) under it
           fourth     The Fourth CI's MASTER VISUAL, PDF p.20: the campaign
                      photograph with the white EXTENDED LOCKUP across its
                      foot ("BEYOND THE THIRD / INTO ——— THE FOURTH / LEVEL OF
                      BUSINESS"), cut as vector by scripts/cut-fourth-lockup.js.
                      The card uses a shorter line (the CI allows it, p.19)
           wellness   Moray Wellness CI's BRANDED TEMPLATE, PDF p.10: "renders
                      must always be presented within the approved branded
                      template" (p.14) — orange bar left, blue bars right,
                      the WHITE logo top centre (white on dark, p.11), BY/
                      MAIN MARKS and 1ST MARK / NEW CAIRO at the foot. The
                      render is the one the CI's own template uses.
           residence  NO brand book received. Set as the brochure's own
                      lockup, PDF p.39 — "R- RESIDENCE by" over the Moray

                      Replace it with their logo file when it arrives.

         Commercial was held back on 2026-09-29 and RELEASED on 2026-10-05
         (build 100): Main Marks' sheet sells ten street-level units.

         `accent` colours the way-in line and the ring on the card. It is
         each line's own accent, from its own CI, never borrowed.

         Every figure is quoted, with its page. The admin size range is
         Moray's brochure (Oct 2025), which predates The Fourth (Sep 2026)
         — whether it includes the fourth floor is not stated. */

      /* THE 14 BUILDINGS (build 107). Roofs traced by hand by Muhanad on the night aerial (1672 x 941 px) in
         tools/trace-building-roofs.html, 2026-10-05; `holds` = the products he ticked for each.
         NAMES: read off The Fourth brochure's labelled master plan (PDF p.13) and its unit tables (p.14-16),
         the Moray brochure plans (p.19-20: C101-C104, HA-HD) and the sheet. Front row A1 B1 C1 D1-D2 E1,
         middle row A2 B2 C2 D3-D4 E2, back row HA HB HC HD. "C1"/"C2" are OUR names for the front and back
         centre blocks: the brochure calls both "C".
         `sheet` = what the inventory's Bldg column calls it. The sheet's "A" is A2 (clinics) and "A01" is A1;
         "D1" and "D2" are one block, so are "D3" and "D4"; "E01" is ASSUMED for E1 (no rows yet).
         The sheet's "B" is TWO blocks: `units` tells them apart by the last two digits of the unit code,
         from The Fourth's tables (B1 = 01-08 and 27-33, B2 = 10-24), ASSUMED the same on every floor.
         A unit that fits no building lights no roof (fail closed); it is still in the lists.
         HOW IT IS USED (js/lineflow.js): on a product page a building is outlined, light blue and tappable,
         ONLY while the sheet has an AVAILABLE unit of that product there (build 108; the grey "holds it but
         nothing available" outline of build 107 was dropped at his word). `holds` only limits which roofs a
         line may light.
         `street` (build 111) = THE STREET-LEVEL SHOPS UNDER THIS BUILDING, as the start of their unit code.
         The sheet files every such shop under Bldg "ST", which names no building; Muhanad, 2026-10-05:
         attach each shop to the building above it, so that roof glows and a tap shows what it carries on
         the street level and the ground floor. Read by POSITION: the street-level plan (Moray brochure
         PDF p.18) laid over the ground-floor plan (p.19), which share one outline. ST02B/ST02A and the two
         STC groups were split the same way. NOT confirmed by Main Marks. A shop that fits no building
         stays under "Street level" in the list and lights no roof.
         `showrooms` (build 112) = the building has SHOWROOMS ON ITS FIRST FLOOR: the five front-row blocks, by the
         green on the brochure's first-floor plan (PDF p.20). With `street` it decides a building's floor cards
         on the Commercial page (ground floor in all 14). */

      /* Unit outlines on the floor drawings — traced by hand by Muhanad in tools/trace-units.html (2026-10-02, 2026-10-05).
         Corners [x, y] in px of img/moray-plan-<floor>.webp: the same space as `plates`.
         Step 3 draws them over the lifted building; a sellable one is tapped to open it (js/lineflow.js unitLayer).
         EVERY unit printed on the drawing is traced, not only the ones in the sheet: an outline is drawn only when
         the sheet has that code, so a unit Main Marks adds later opens by itself.
         Checked on arrival (2026-10-05): every outline within 12% of the size its printed m² implies, none leaves its cut,
         no overlap beyond a half-pixel sliver between E116 and E117.
