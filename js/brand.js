  /* ---- moving between pages ------------------------------------------
     These are real, separate pages — that is what makes Back work and a
     link shareable. So the app fades the page out before it navigates
     and fades the next one in on arrival, which is what stops the app
     reading as a set of separate web pages.

     BOTH HALVES OR NEITHER. Arriving is pure CSS (styles.css animates
     the document on load, with fill-mode both), so a page always fades
     IN even if this file never runs. Leaving is the half that needs
     JavaScript, and it is capped by a timer: a transition that does not
     finish must never strand somebody on the page they are leaving.

     NOT USED HERE YET: the browser's own cross-document View
     Transitions. Chrome and Safari have them, Firefox does not, and
     running both at once double-animates. One behaviour, tested
     everywhere, beats two that fight. It is the upgrade, not the base. */

     screen at the moment of the swap is invisible. The next page then
     rises out of the same darkness.

  /* ---- ACCESS GRANTED: the crossing ----------------------------------
     Two halves of one movement, written together so they cannot drift:
     `cross()` is played by the page that LEAVES, `land()` by the page
     that ARRIVES. The CSS is under "the crossing" in styles.css.

     The hand-over happens with the overlay fully formed and completely
     still, and the arriving page paints that same still picture in its
     first frame with transitions off. Two documents can never be
     composited together, so the trick is to give them nothing to
     interpolate: one static state both pages agree on.

     Both halves are driven by TIMERS. If a transition is throttled,
     unsupported or skipped, the timers still run and the page still
     changes — nobody is left looking at a black screen. */

  /* THESE THREE NUMBERS ARE THE PACE OF THE WHOLE THING.

     The last thing to finish forming is line 4, at 670ms (a .27s delay
     plus a .4s travel). XF_IN must be COMFORTABLY PAST THAT, for two
     separate reasons:

       1. the hand-over has to land on a still frame. At 640ms it did
          not: line 4 and the centre rule were still moving, and the
          arriving page painted them finished, so they snapped. That is
          the one seam this design exists to avoid;
       2. the message has to be readable. Measured at 640ms, ACCESS
          GRANTED and "Select a project" were fully formed and still
          for 382ms — below a comfortable read, and worse than that
          sounds, because the eye is on the button when it is tapped
          and has to travel to the middle of the screen first.

     1000ms leaves 330ms of completely still time before the hand-over.
     Measured end to end, the message is fully legible for about 830ms,
     up from 382ms. If it ever needs to feel quicker, these
     are the numbers to move — nothing else. */
